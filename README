This a simple custom URL handler written in Cocoa.  It's surprisingly little
code for what it does.  It parses the url that's provided and calls an
internal tool that's a shell command.  With this we can login to environments
automagically. :)

To install simply do the following:
% xcodebuild
% sudo cp -r build/Release/YardBulls.app /Applications
