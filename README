This a simple custom URL handler written in Cocoa.  It's surprisingly little
code for what it does.  It parses the url that's provided and calls an
internal tool that's a shell command.  With this we can login to environments
automagically. :)

To install simply do the following:
% rake
% Checkout the "Log Me In" link on an enivornments page in ninja

This really only parses urls that are formed like "appcloud://compton"  It
grabs the environment name, compton, and shells out to ey terminal.  Hopefully
it'll save you some typing.

I'd like to redo this to run any applescript returned from a remote host but I'm
a little strapped for time.  Please hit me up if this helped anyone or you do 
something cooler.
